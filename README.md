# Image-Analysis-for-NS_00X-Lines
Code Repo for different Image Analysis techniques of our NS_00X trials using Donald Danforth's Data Science Team's in house created software, called PlantCV.  This software was built to run images of plants through it to obtain different values such as RGB, Hyperspectral, and Morphological characteristics of plants being studied. 

## Python with PlantCV
For these projects, I used interactive coding environments in the cloud (Jupyter notebook) with importing and working with image data in Python using PlantCV and other open-source tools.
